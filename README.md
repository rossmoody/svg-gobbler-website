## About

5 versions and 5+ years ago, this started as a pet project to improve the
[SVG Crowbar](https://github.com/nytimes/svg-crowbar) tool that is no longer being maintained by NY
Times.

### Open source

This extension is open source and doesn't collect any information from users. It's free, and made
available because I enjoy making useful things for the web. Please consider contributing with an
idea, bug fix, or feature request.
